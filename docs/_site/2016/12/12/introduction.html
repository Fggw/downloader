<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Food inspections are a critical public good provided by cities big and small across the United States. They can, if timely, contain public health problems that could otherwise result in deep and damaging outcomes for cities. In the city of Chicago, some three dozen inspectors are tasked with inspecting over 15,000 establishments - upwards of 400 inspections per inspector per year.</p>

<p>Inspectors then are a crucial but constrained resource. And intuitively, inspecting risky establishments earlier is important from a public health perspective. For each day a violating establishment is allowed to continue to sell to customers, those customers are at risk of illness and spreading that illness. Devising a data-driven strategy to allocate inspectors to inspections across the city could overcome the overall shortage by targeting risky establishments earlier.</p>

<p>In 2014, several governmental agencies and non-governmental agencies - all stakeholders in Chicago welfare - teamed up to apply data science tools to allocate its inspectors to achieve better inspection outcomes. Their results were well-recieved: during a two-month test of tracking inspections, the team discovered that had their approach been implemented for these inspections, 69 percent of inspections with critical violations (compared to an actual 55 percent of inspections with critical violations) would have been found during the first month.</p>

<p>We wished to revisit this now two-year old but still relevant question. Could the model built by the city of Chicago be improved upon? What additional data could we draw from or alternative insights could we take from the data to flag risky establishments earlier? Ultimately, through careful collection, collation, and analysis of data we constructed a model and methodology to work well in the cityâ€™s favor. Our outcome suggests similar analytics could be a boon to cities suffering similar constrained resources across the United States.</p>
