<h1>Data Exploration</h1>

<p>We then moved on to the Data Exploration process.
We expected ex-ante that the relationship between
our predictors and the response would be highly
non-linear, so we tried to develop some
intuition, using visualization, about relationships
between some of the variables and the inspection
outcomes.</p>

<p><img src="/foodinspections/images/Failures_by_License.png" alt="License_Type" /></p>

<p>Given that we had information on the establishment type 
for each business, we bucketed failure rate and 
fraction of total inspections by establishment type.</p>

<p>This revealed that businesses categorized as “Taverns,” 
vendors of tobacco, or sites of entertainment had the 
highest failure rates, hovering around 25%.</p>

<p>Establishments 
with the following categorizations were also among the 
worst-performing in inspections, averaging fail rates 
around 23%:</p>

<ul>
  <li>food and seating</li>
  <li>liquor and outdoors,</li>
  <li>consumption of liquor on premise</li>
  <li>sales of packaged liquor</li>
  <li>food and dining area</li>
  <li>sales of perishable foods,</li>
  <li>catering of liquor.</li>
</ul>

<p>The common theme is that 
liquor or tobacco licensees tended to 
have higher fail rates than the average chicago 
establishment.</p>

<h3 id="failures-by-reason-for-inspection">Failures by Reason for Inspection</h3>

<p>We also explored whether the reason for an inspection
could provide useful information about inspection
outcomes by visualizing the inspections by the reason
for which the inspection took place.</p>

<p><img src="/foodinspections/images/Failures_by_Inspection_Type.png" alt="Inspection_Reason" /></p>

<p>Inspections take place for different reasons, and it’s 
intuitive that the reason for an inspection should
be related to its outcome. The data indicated trends
consistent with this intuition.</p>

<p>For example: inspections generated by the license task 
force, which verifies licenses, resulted in failures
at a rate of 60%. This make sense considering that
an inspection referred by the license task force
means that a Department of Public Health employee was
already present at the establishment and would only
recommend further inspection after observing a problem.</p>

<p>The second highest fail rate has a similarly intuitive
possible explanation: when establishments apply for
new licenses, their health standards must be verified. 
These new establishments seem to be more likely to fail,
perhaps due to lack of familiarity with the health code.</p>
