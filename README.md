# How to use this script

1. Clone this repository and change directories into it, by running:
```
git clone git@github.com:Fggw/downloader.git
cd downloader
```

2. open `download.py` and find the `SOCRATA_TOKEN` variable. Change its value to what Sam sent. 

3. Run the script with `python download.py -d MM/DD/YYYY`, where the date-looking thing is the *earliest* date you want to download.

4. Wait.

5. Profit.
